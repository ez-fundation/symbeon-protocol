# 🛡️ Skill: Sovereign Codex

## 1. Purpose
This repository is the **Manifesto**. It documents the "Sovereign Codex" methodology: Archive -> Bridge -> Seed -> Generate. It aligns the entire organization under a unified philosophical framework.

## 2. Capabilities
- **Methodology**: Defines the "Why" and "How" of EZ Foundation's existence.
- **Strategic Map**: Documents the 3 Pillars (Archaeology, Logic, Generation).
- **Onboarding**: The entry point for understanding the ecosystem's high-level goals.

## 3. Usage Rules
- **Philosophy First**: Technical decisions in other repos must align with the principles defined here.
- **Living Document**: This protocol evolves as the studio matures.

## 4. Visibility Strategy: [PUBLIC]
**Reason**: To build a movement, you must share the philosophy. Publicly documenting our methodology builds trust and attracts alignment/talent.
